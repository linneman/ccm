<div class="textblock"><h2>Object</h2>
<p>The original motivation for the development of communication channels for TinyScheme was the processing of the Hayes AT command set as used in USB based Wireless Mobile Communication Devices (USB CDC-TCM). Since we believe that there is much broader scope of potential applications, the implementation should be considered as a general design pattern for event processing with an embedded scheme interpreter.</p>
<h2>Channels</h2>
<p>The communication channels presented here are an abstraction of processes linked to queues. This allows to sequentially process events from sereval input queues without blocking the data sources such as TCP/UDP interprocess commincation sockets and device files e.g. for serial line communication or any other I/O based data streams. The fundamental concept is strongly influenced by <a href="http://clojure.com/blog/2013/06/28/clojure-core-async-channels.html">Clojure's core.async</a> library and Go language channels but the implementation given here has more in common with Javascript's event mechanism. Unlike Clojure, TinyScheme is like Javascript single threaded which is important as a precondition for its compactness and simplicity.</p>
<p>All concurrent operations for the decoupling of external data sources and synchronous processing are realized by native posix threads. The main focus of this approach is expressiveness, extensibility and compactness for applications which do not explicitly demand for maximum throughput or strict real-time capability. Many applications such as parsing, filtering and distribution of Hayes AT command sequences as presented here fall in this category. </p><pre class="fragment"> --------                        ---------                       ---------
| Socket | -- Reader Thread --&gt;  | queue |  --&gt; Proc Thread --&gt; / Scheme /
 --------                        ---------                      ---------
</pre><p>The reader thread constantly reads data from a data source which can be a file, a client or a server socket and stores the result in an data queue. The processing thread reads out elements or data chunks from that queue and feeds them into the scheme interpreter by invoking a callback function with that data. The scheme interpreter is protected by a mutex which guarantees that only one processing thread at a time can be executed. Given that the scheme programmer has not to worry about thread safeness at all. He can safely update internal state and write out data to any channel from any function respectively callback function context.</p>
<h2>How to build</h2>
<h3>Build and Runtime Dependencies</h3>
<p>In addition to the commonly used Unix system libraries and build tools such as libc, pthreads and the autobuild suite, tcm depends on three utitily libraries, libcutils, libintercom and tinyscheme which are maintained respectily provided by the same author.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/linneman/tinyscheme">tinyscheme</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/linneman/libcutils">libcutils</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/linneman/libintercom">libintercom</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to compile and install these libraries on your system first. Refer to the installation instructions on Github for for further explanation how to do this.</p>
<h3>Download and Compile</h3>
<p>Compiling tcm is done in the very same way as for libcutils and libintercom following the guidelines of the free software foundation: </p><pre class="fragment">git clone git://github.com/linneman/tcm.git
cd tcm

./autogen # invokes autoreconf -i for config script generation

./configure
make
make install # as root
</pre><p>In case you have downloaded an official release as gzipped tarball you will exclusively need the last three commands since the configure script is already delivered with stable releases.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the fact that add on libraries are per default installed under the directory <code>/usr/local/lib</code> which is not in the library path on many linux distributions. Thus you will need to put <code>/usr/local/lib</code> to your library path e.g. by defining the enviroment variable </p><pre class="fragment">export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib.
</pre><p>Alternatively, you can edit <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> which contains the default directories searched. Note that you may also need to update the cache <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code> by running ldconfig (as root or with sudo).</p>
<h2>Working with TinyScheme</h2>
<p>The TinyScheme interpreter is embedded in the daemon application 'tcm' which can be integrated into system startup files or started from a shell via the following command: </p><pre class="fragment">tcm
</pre><h3>Scheme Startup File</h3>
<p>The application reads initially the expressions defined in the startup file 'tcm.scm' which is expected to be stored under the directory /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin. The tcm startup file delivered with this repository contains all definition required for the 'telephone control model' but the content can be easily extended or replaced by arbitrary scheme code. It is neverless a good idea to refer to tcm.scm at first to get an idea how the code is working.</p>
<h3>REPL</h3>
<p>The daemon starts by default a socket based 'Read Eval Print Loop' (REPL) on TCP port 37147. The port can be changed or the REPL feature can be completely disabled by changing the definitions in the configuration file /etc/tcm.rc.</p>
<p>A REPL is thremendous tool for rapid application development since it allows to change and extend a scheme application while it is running. In example use the following command on a platform shell to connect to tcm's embedded REPL: </p><pre class="fragment">telnet localhost 37147
</pre><p>Be aware of the packet based transmission between the telnet session and the REPL where carriage retrun / line feed characters separate evaluated data chunks from each other. This characteristics causes problems when scheme functions are separated by line separator characters. These characters shall be therefore omitted or replaced by spaces to allow the scheme interpreter to evualte a form as a whole. Rewrite in example the following function declaration: </p><pre class="fragment">(define (modem-tcm-event-handler s)
  (write-channel host-tcm-ch s))
</pre><p>as one single line: </p><pre class="fragment">(define (modem-tcm-event-handler s) (write-channel host-tcm-ch s))
</pre><p>The replacement of CR/LF characters shall be integrated into your LISP coding environment in example Emacs or ViM. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/linneman/emacs-setup">OL's Emacs setup</a> for REPL extensions for scheme to send the expression under the cursor respectively the form under the cursor with the key strokes 'C-c x' and 'C-c e' to the <em>shell</em> buffer where the REPL connection shall be previously enbaled. These key strokes allow to constantly evaluate scheme expressions in the target environment while there are written and thus thremendously accelerating coding and debugging sessions.</p>
<h2>Creating Communication Channels</h2>
<p>The following code snippet gives an illustration how to create two interconnected TCP server channels. Both restrict connections from localhost, channel number one listens to port 5000, channel number two listens to port 5001: </p><pre class="fragment">(define ch1
  (make-server-sock-channel "127.0.0.1" 5000
                            (lambda (s) (write-channel ch2 s))))

(define ch2
  (make-server-sock-channel "127.0.0.1" 5001
                            (lambda (s) (write-channel ch1 s))))
</pre><p>The callback handlers just forward their data which is bound to the string variable 's' to the other channel. In additaion to the native scheme function make-server-sock-channel there is currently its counterpart make-client-sock-channel and make-dev-channel for linking a device file e.g. for a serial line interface, a virtual terminal or any other device file which operates on small data chunks of currently 256 bytes per chunk. All of these functions return a channel descriptor which shall be stored for later usage e.g. when writing to this channel or to finally close the channel by invoking the native function close-channel.</p>
<h2>Routing</h2>
<p>Originally TCM has been implemented to extend respectively partially overload the AT Hayes command set data stream which is interchanged between a file interface to an embedded System on Chip modem and virtual Linux USB TTY device representing the USB CDC-TCM/ACM device class. A small library implemented in TinyScheme has been provided for these routing purposes where most of the strings are just exchanged between these device files but some of them trigger additional actions.</p>
<p>The idea has been orinally inspired by Clojure's <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a> frameworks but the implementation presented here has bee adjusted to the needs of this AT command set proxy. The general routing implemention can be found in the scheme function 'routes.scm' which is included by 'tcm.scm' and thus also evaluated during system startup.</p>
<p>A route is considered a scheme function which maps an input string to an output string when the route becomes active or to logical false (#f) when the route does not apply. Several routes are combined in a list. The scheme function route applies the list of routes to a string. The macro functions 'define-route' and 'msg-begins-with' simplifies the definition of routing functions.</p>
<p>Example: </p><pre class="fragment">(define-routes tst-routes
  (msg-begins-with "TOK1" (begin "got token1"))
  (msg-begins-with "TOK2" (begin "got token2")))
</pre><p>defines the list of routes 'tst-routes' for mapping strings which begin with the tokens "TOK1" and "TOK2". The following example illustrates how to apply these routes to a given string: </p><pre class="fragment">(route my-routes "tok1") -&gt; "got token 1"
(route my-routes "tok2") -&gt; "got token 2"
(route my-routes "xy")   -&gt; "xy"
</pre><p>The macro 'msg-begins-with' binds the symbol 'args' to the character string providing the string's rest after the token: </p><pre class="fragment">(define-routes tst-routes
  (msg-begins-with "TOKA" (begin "got token A"))
  (msg-begins-with "TOKB" (begin (string-append "got TOKB with args: " args))))

(route tst-routes "TOKB3") -&gt; "got TOKB with args: 3"
</pre><p>This allows to further process argument lists.</p>
<p>The concrete Hayes proxy implementation currently comes with only one sample implementation to forward the Hayes command to adjust the playback volume to an external sound controler (ALSAUCM) listening on port 5044. Later implementations might follow.</p>
