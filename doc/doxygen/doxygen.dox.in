/**
 * @defgroup tcm Asynchronous Communication Channels for TinyScheme
 * @brief tcm Version @VERSION@
 *
 * @section tcm About TCM
 *
 * The  original  motivation for  the  development  of communication  channels  for
 * TinyScheme was the processing  of the Hayes AT command set as  used in USB based
 * Wireless Mobile Communication Devices (USB CDC-TCM). Since we believe that there
 * is much  broader scope of  potential applications, the implementation  should be
 * considered as  a general design  pattern for  event processing with  an embedded
 * scheme interpreter.
